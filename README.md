Cricket Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing T20 cricket batting data by cleaning, exploring, and visualizing key performance metrics through an interactive dashboard.

Project Overview
Data Cleaning (SQL):

Removed duplicate records.
Standardized data (e.g., split Player column into separate fields).
Removed irrelevant columns for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Pandas and NumPy to analyze trends in player performance.
Created visualizations using Matplotlib to identify key patterns in batting data.
Dashboard:

Transformed T20 batting data into an interactive dashboard for easy visualization and insights.
Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL): Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Pandas & NumPy: Data analysis and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Power BI/Tableau (if used): Dashboard creation.
Results & Insights
Identified trends in T20 batting performances.
Built visualizations to compare players' key statistics.
Designed an interactive dashboard for data-driven analysis.
How to Use
Database Setup: Import and clean the dataset using the SQL scripts.
EDA & Visualization: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore trends in cricket data.
Dashboard: Open the dashboard file to interact with the visual insights.
